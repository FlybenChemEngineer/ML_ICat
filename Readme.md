The datasets used for building models in this job, as well as the experimental data, are all stored in the 'Dataset' folder.

Before running the program, you need to install packages such as numpy, pandas, rdkit, sklearn, torch, optuna, etc.

The main function of the program is in ICat_main.py, where the overall computational logic of the entire code is written. The 'Model' folder contains all the machine learning algorithms used in this work. ICat_xgb1205 is the trained model.
